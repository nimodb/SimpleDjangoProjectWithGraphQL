# Creating a Simple Django Project with GraphQL

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple Django project with GraphQL integration. We'll create a project called "core" and an app called "books". The "books" app will have a model with title and author fields. We'll set up GraphQL to query the books. Finally, we'll add some sample data to the database and test the GraphQL endpoint.
